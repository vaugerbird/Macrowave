Macrowave is based on and uses the schematic from the Freedeck project: https://github.com/FreeYourStream

-- Flashing the Pro Micro --
Use the Arduino IDE to flash the Pro Micro: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
The Freedeck software is here: https://github.com/FreeYourStream/freedeck-ino
Note that you will need to install some specific Arduino libraries as mentioned on the github.
app.ino is the file you need to open and flash in the Arduino IDE.

-- Making a config.bin --
Go to https://freedeck.gosewis.ch/
This is the configurator for the Freedeck, Add a page via the button in the top left and start customising your device.
There is a folder of images/icons provided alongside this txt file to get you started. There is also a premade config.bin file that you can load as an example.
Place your config.bin file onto a FAT/FAT32 formatted micro SD card, in the root directory.

-- Soldering the boards --
This is a simple guide and assumes you have some common sense.
The components must be soldered in a specific order, read the guide before starting.
1. Start with the six SMD buttons.
2. The SN74HC4051N chips are next, make sure you put them on the correct way round (indicated on the board).
3. Bend the pins of the Micro SD Module so that they are perpendicular to the board, then solder it on.
4. The Pro Micro should have come with some header pins, solder them to the Middle PCB but do not solder the Pro Micro on yet.
5. Now trim all the legs on the side of the Middle PCB that the screens will be placed on.
6. Now solder the screens on, ensuring that they are straight and that the buttons are NOT pressed by default.
7. Trim the legs of the top center screen so that they won't touch the Pro Micro.
8. Solder on the flashed Pro Micro.
9. Insert the Micro SD card with the config.bin file.
10. Solder the male header pins to the Top PCB.
11. Solder the female header pins to the Bottom PCB.
12. Slide the Middle PCB onto the male header pins of the Top PCB, then plug it into the female header pins of the Bottom PCB, sandwiching the Middle PCB between them. Make sure the buttons all click and behave as expected. If you connect the Top and Bottom too tightly you may find that the buttons don't depress, loosen it up a little.
13. Stick the rubber feet in the circles on the Bottom PCB.
14. Plug it into your PC and it should all be working.

-- Using the Macrowave --
Since the buttons are along the lower edge of the screens, which are hinged at the top, pressing the lower edge of the screens will be easier.
You don't need to remove the Micro SD card to update the configuration; the Settings in the configurator allow you to read and write to the SD card.
